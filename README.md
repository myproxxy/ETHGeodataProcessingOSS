Create a new Environment in Anaconda Navigator by importing the .yaml file in this directory.
After this, activate the newly created environment and run a Jupyter Notebook (open a terminal from this environment and enter "jupyter notebook").
Open the Jupyter Notebook in this directory and run through it - MIND YOU: you need to download the "Data"-directory first and both the data directory and the Jupyter Notebook must be in the same directory.

Alternatively you can run the following command from your terminal / command window:
conda create -f GeoProc2023ETHInstalledBackup.yaml
